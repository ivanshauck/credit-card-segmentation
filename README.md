The purpose of this project is to segment credit card customers based on their spending habits from the previous 6 months.
The data comes from kaggle and includes information on over 9000 customers.
This project utilizes clustering techniques with python through pandas and sci kit learn.
The final results come from a KMeans algorithm run with 3 clusters.
The groups end up being split into two big spender groups, and 1 lower spending group.
The two big spender groups are separated by the fact that one makes most purchases with their credit card, while one gets large amounts of cash advances from their card.
